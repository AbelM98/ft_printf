# 🖨️ ft_printf

**Personal implementation of `printf` from `<stdio.h>`**

## 📌 Short Description
This project is part of the 42 Cursus.  
It focuses on low-level memory management and handling multiple arguments, introducing the `<stdarg.h>` library.  
Data parsing is also a valuable skill developed through this project.

## ⚡ Supported Specifiers
`%%`, `%c`, `%d`, `%s`, `%p`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`

## 🛠️ Compilation & Usage
To compile and run with `main.c`:

`bash
make
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
./a.out`
This will show a simple contrasted behavior test between my implementation and the standard function. 
Feel free to test anything!

Have a nice one!
